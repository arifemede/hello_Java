        /*
          What is the differences between primitive and non primitive data type? - Interview question

         primitives contain just values, non primitives contain values and methods inside container

        primitives start with lower case, non primitives start with upper case

        created by Java, we can not create primitive data types, non primitives can be created by programmer

        the size of primitive data types depend on the data type, non primitives have all the same size
